<h3>How to check if given four points form a square</h3>
</head>
<body>
	<p>
		Given coordinates of four points in a plane, find if the four points
		form a square or not.
		<!--more-->
		<br> To check for square, we need to check for following.
		<br>
		a) All fours sides formed by points are same.
		<br> 
		b) The angle between any two sides is 90 degree. 
		(This condition is required as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral">Quadrilateral </a>also has same sides.
		<br> 
		c) Check both the diagonals have same distance.
