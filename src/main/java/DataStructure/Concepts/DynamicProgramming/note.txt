1. Understand the Core Idea
    DP is used for problems with:
        Overlapping subproblems:
            The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are reused multiple times.
    Optimal substructure:
        The optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.
    Key difference from divide-and-conquer:
        DP memoizes/caches solutions to subproblems to avoid recomputation.

2. Identify DP Problems
    Look for problems where:
        You’re asked to find the "maximum," "minimum," "number of ways," or "whether something is possible."
    The problem involves sequences (e.g., arrays, strings) or states (e.g., grid paths, knapsack).

3. Steps to Solve DP Problems (Mantra of DP)
    a) Define the State.                            -> What does dp[i] or dp[i][j] represent?
    b) Formulate the Recurrence/Recursive Relation. -> How does the state relate to overlapping smaller subproblems?
    c) Initialize Base Cases.                       -> Set the smallest subproblem solutions.
    d) Choose a Direction (Top-Down or Bottom-Up).  -> TDM or BUT
    e) Optimize Space (if possible)                 -> state array vs previous 2 state in variables.


a) Define the State:
    What does dp[i] or dp[i][j] represent?
        Example:
        In Fibonacci, dp[i] = Fibonacci number at index i.
        In grid paths, dp[i][j] = number of ways to reach cell (i,j).
b) Formulate the Recurrence/Recursive Relation:
    How does the state relate to smaller subproblems?
        Example:
        Fibonacci: dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2].
        Coin Change: dp[amount] = min(dp[amount], 1 + dp[amount - coin]).
c) Initialize Base Cases:
    Set the smallest subproblem solutions.
        Example:
        Fibonacci: dp[0] = 0, dp[1] = 1.
        Grid paths: dp[0][0] = 1.
d) Choose a Direction (Top-Down or Bottom-Up)
    Top-Down (Memoization): Recursive + cache.
        python:
            memo = {}
            def fib(n):
                if n in memo: return memo[n]
                if n <= 1: return n
                memo[n] = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
                return memo[n]
    Bottom-Up (Tabulation): Iterative + table.
        python:
            def fib(n):
                dp = [0, 1] + [0]*(n-1)
                for i in range(2, n+1):
                    dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
                return dp[n]
e) Optimize Space (if possible)
    Replace full tables with variables for states that depend on a few previous values.
    Example: Fibonacci only needs prev and curr.
